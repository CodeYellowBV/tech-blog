A frontend package built upon [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) to add models and collections. It has first-class support for relations and can communicate to a backend.
By default it comes with a "communication layer" for [Django Binder](/code/djangobinder), which is Code Yellow's Python backend framework. It is easy to add support for another backend.
Mobx-spine is highly inspired by Backbone and by the package we built on top of Backbone, Backbone Relation.
